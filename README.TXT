Genetic Algorithm Solver for Simple Substitution Ciphers
Mark Janssen   

The files archived here should be the following:

GA-SOLVE.EXE    Genetic Algorithm Solver for Simple Substition Ciphers
GA-SOLVE.PAS    Turbo Pascal 6.0 source code for above
MAKEDI  .EXE    Makes customized digram statistic files for given input text
MAKEDI  .PAS    Source code for above
DIGRAMS .DAT    A standard digram frequency table for the English language
SAMPLE  .CXT    Sample ciphertext
SAMPLE  .TXT    Cleartext of above
SAMPLEDI.DAT    Digram file for SAMPLE.TXT
README  .TXT    This file

Note that GA-SOLVE does not need to start with encrypted text for it to
be interesting.  Since the initial gene pool will start out with random
keys, it will effectively encrypt the file for you and show you the de-
crypt text, otherwise you can start with a sample ciphertext file in
SAMPLE.CXT.

"Use of a Genetic Algorithm in the Cyptanalysis of Simple Substitution 
        Ciphers," CRYPTOLOGIA, Volume XVII, Number 1 (Jan 1993).
